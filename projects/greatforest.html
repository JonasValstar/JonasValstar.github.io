                        For this kids game, i was the lead programmer that made the player and camera control system along with a dialogue system, a parkour race and a boss-fight. 
                        The camera and player controls were inspired by how they are designed in the TT lego games with our own changes. The game also features a lot of dialogue 
                        so i also designed a system to manage that dialogue and display it to the player. This system would by used by other team members, so i made sure to make it 
                        as user friendly as i could. The parkour race uses unity's nav-mesh and off-mesh links along with a custom system to make the bunny (the player opponent) take 
                        breaks. The boss-fight i made to have any amount of fully adjustable stages with puzzle and attack stages switching between each other. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the 3rd project of my studies we had to make kids for a pretend client. After 2 failed concepts, we eventually started working on this concept that did work. 
                        I first made the player and camera controls because they were the most important to get right. The system was inspired by how it works in most TT lego games 
                        because it works great for puzzle games which our game was. After we made concepts for level 2 and 3, we knew we also wanted a parkour race in level 2 and a 
                        boss-fight to end the game in level 3. I started with making the boss-fight, so that we could test the difficulty with the target audience as soon as possible. 
                        after making the main system of the boss-fight, i made the parkour race work. The team member making the story also wanted to put in the dialogue, so in between 
                        i made the dialogue system. 
                    </p>

                    The last level in the game would be a boss-fight that would act as the epic conclusion to the story. Because the game is a puzzle game in it's core, the way the 
                    player damages the boss should be a puzzle mechanic to keep things consistent. This is why we opted to go for a system where puzzle and attack stage would alternate. 
                    In the puzzle stage, the player would do the mole's puzzle introduced in level one to make sure the player doesn't need to quickly learn a whole new system. After 
                    testing resulted that the puzzle alone was a bit boring, I also added a attack the player would have to dodge in this stage. The attack stage is a stage where the 
                    player just has to survive until the stage is over. During that, the boss would fire plenty off attacks their way which the player needs to dodge. Because we planned 
                    on only having 2 attack stages, i made 2 different attacks. The first was an easy wave attack the player could either dodge or jump over. The second attack was 
                    introduced in the second attack stage and was a circle attack that would spawning a circle of which the radius would increase. Because we were going to test the fight 
                    a lot and needed to tweak it quickly, i made all stage settings stored inside of scriptable objects. These scriptable objects would be added to a list and that would 
                    be the amount of stages. Every even stage (beginning at 0) would be a mole puzzle and all the odd stages would be attack ones.

                    In the second level the player would have to win race against a bunny to proceed. The first idea was to make this by placing invisible platforms between the actual 
                    platforms for the bunny to walk over. But when i found out off-mesh links existed, I opted for that instead. The normal way for the ai to take an off-mesh however 
                    is straight. When searching for a way to make it more like a jump I found a tutorial that explained how that could be done. With that issue fixed, there was still 
                    the fact that the bunny was a lot faster than the player, especially kids. It wouldn't make sense that a bunny is bad at jumping so I came up with the solution to 
                    make the bunny be exhausted every couple of jumps. The way i made that is by giving the script an amount of rest moments. It would then calculate the average amount 
                    of jumps between rests, which was used to give every rest moment a random interval between 1 and 2 times the average. Lastly I made the script check if the total 
                    amount of jumps wasn't more or less that the total amount of real jumps. If that was the case it would randomly remove or add to the moments until it matched up.

            <div class="collContent" id="coll_dialogue">
                <p>
                    The game would be telling most of the story and some mechanics through the dialogue the player could have with the animals. It was therefore essential that it 
                    worked without any bugs and was easy to use for implementing new dialogue. I started with the writing 'animation'. I made it work so that every set interval it 
                    would write one more character from a text string. If a certain button was pressed it would skip and display the full string. The same button would then be used 
                    to enter the next window and that text would start to be written. After all the windows were displayed, it would display the set response options. Theses buttons 
                    could be set-up to start a new dialogue or to exit out of dialogue. The way i made it work is by making all dialogue parts a scriptable object. Every setting could 
                    be adjusted in the scriptable object and then dragged into a list of all parts. In the response options an index could then be given of a new dialogue to load 
                    corresponding with the index of the dialogue scriptable object.

                <p>
                    The way the camera and player moves is inspired by the TT Lego games. The camera always looks from a certain side and rotates to keep the player in view. If the 
                    camera has to rotate more than a certain amount of degrees it moves to the left, right, up or down. If the player comes too close or goes to far away, the camera 
                    moves away or towards. This simple system combined with certain area's where the camera has a fixed position makes the camera system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player's movement is based on the rotation of the camera to make sure the player always walks forward from where the player sees the player character. The player 
                    also has a system that if the character's chest to feet touch the ledge of a platform it will climb up. This was implemented after we got feedback that the jumping 
                    was too difficult.
