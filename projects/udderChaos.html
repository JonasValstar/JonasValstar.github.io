                    <p>
                        For an informatics project on my highschool, I made a game together with my friends. I was the only programmer on the team, and i made the movement system, 
                        weapon and blocking system, UI and all the other programming and unity related things. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        I made first made the movement system the characters would use. I used unity's build in physics system to apply force to the character and set the drag to zero 
                        to create a sliding effect that would result in standing on a skateboard. By releasing all movement keys the drag would return and the player would stop sliding. 
                        After that i made the weapons. We had 3 different weapons types in the game: gun, laser and melee. Every weapon had it's own settings that were changed in that 
                        weapons scriptable object. The gun simple shot a bullet or multiple in the direction that the gun was facing. The weapons don't alway face the mouse because each 
                        weapon had a weight and would take some time to rotate towards the mouse direction. The gun specifically also has bullet spread making snipers more accurate than 
                        pistols. The laser shot a line straight in the direction the weapon was facing. The end point was detected using a raycast where the player themselves didn't get 
                        taken into account. The melee weapon simply does damage inside of a circular area around the weapon. The weapons themselves I made randomly drop from the sky. 
                        I also made the player able to block. When the player does so, the area itself shrinks slowly giving a timer to the player. If not blocking anymore it would 
                        slowly restore. Lastly, I designed the UI to have bright contrasting colours along with a moving diagonal striped background because i though it fit the game 
                        well. I made all the submenu's slide underneath the main bar this worked great for both the main menu and the pause menu.

                    After the original project files corrupted i thought it would be nice to make a time-lapse of the recovery of progress and addition of new content. I didn't have to 
                    do everything again because i could still read the scripts, but a lot of things had to be done from scratch again. The total length of the original footage is around 
                    8 hours long.
