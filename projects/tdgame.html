                        My friends and I decided enter the GameJam that our school was hosting for christmas. As the only programmer it was my task to battle unity and make everything 
                        work in time. I made turret placing system based on a grid with snapping and collision detection. I also made the turrets automatically aim for the closest 
                        target.

                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        As most GameJams, the design process was a bit hectic. The theme of the jam was day and night, and after some brainstorming we came up with a tower defense game 
                        where you could build during the day and defend during the night. We had great plans to add multiple enemies and turrets, but in hindsight we should've known 
                        that we would have to downscale that with a 24 hours time limit. I first made the grid placing system while my friends made a lot of sprites. After making that I 
                        implemented the first turret we designed, the basic machine gun turret. After that was done i made a very crude system for spawning enemies and by that time, the 
                        time was up.

                <p>
                    For the building system we opted to make it grid based. The way I achieved this is by rounding the position of the mouse to the nearest grid location. I also made 
                    check that would check if there was something on the currently select tile. If that was the case, the sprite would turn red and couldn't be build anymore.
                </p>

            <button class="collButton" id="aiming" onclick="openColl(this.id)"><b>Auto Aiming Turrets</b></button>
            <div class="collContent" id="coll_aiming">
                <p>
                    The turrets that the player placed also had to automatically aim at the enemies. The way i did this is by adding a circle collider to each turret respective to that 
                    turrets range. If an enemy would walk into the collider it would be added to a list of all enemies in range. Each time an enemy was killed, it would then check for 
                    the nearest enemy and start shooting at that one.
