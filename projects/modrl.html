                    <p>
                        As part of out intro week for the second year of my study, our school hosted a 48 hour GameJam with the theme 'Together'. For this game we came up with the idea 
                        that 2 players control the same character. I would make sure the player could shoot bullets and had to reload, that they did damage to enemies and they could get 
                        new weapons in a shop.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the first day we came up with the concept of the game. A 2 player game where one would walk a mech, and the other would be in charge of shooting. One of the 
                        things we wanted was for both players to have to rely on each other. So, for example, the player who would move would also reload the weapons of the shooter. I 
                        firstly made the shooting work while my co-programmer worked on the enemy spawn and behaviour. After we were both done, we merged the 2 projects into one and I 
                        continued with making the weapon shop and UI. With little sleep and little time left before the deadline I made some last minute tweaks and implemented the player 
                        model someone else made into a playable, although somewhat interesting, end result.

                <p>
                    For the game i wanted to work on making the weapons and how enemies handle taking damage. I had an idea to make the enemies more interesting by adding elemental 
                    damage to weapons and give bullets a change of critically hitting the enemy. The original plan was to also make it depend on what part of the enemy the player would 
                    should, but the models of the enemies we decided upon weren't really suited for multiple hit-boxes. I made a system that weapons can have a basic damage as well as 
                    elemental damage, and enemies can be neutral, resistant or weak to certain elements. If an enemy was resistant to a specific type of elemental damage it would ignore 
                    all elemental damage and only take basic damage. Weak enemies would take double elemental damage on top of the basic damage. If a crit hit was scored it would multiply 
                    the total amount of damage with 1.5
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the aspects of our idea was to make a weapons shop where to players could go to and get better weapons. The first idea for the game was for it to be more 
                    Roguelike, so i designed the store to offer the player a random selection of pre-determined weapons. It would add better weapons to the pool of available weapons 
                    the further the player got. The player could then also select on which side they wanted to equip the new weapon.

                <p>
                    The game also needed a UI, of which the responsibility of making it was handed to me when dividing the programming roles. I opted for a very standard looking 
                    sci-fi UI, seeing as it was a GameJam and i can't draw. In the top the plan was to add a health bar, but this was later changed to a timer, and in the bottom 
                    corners it made sense to put the ammo counts for the left and right weapon. One of my teammates suggested giving the bland looking UI a drop-shadow, which also 
                    looked good as a glow. As an improvement of UX, i thought it would be a cool idea to link the color of the glow to the players health (and later time left) which 
                    ended up looking pretty good and have the player a good way of subconsciously knowing if they had enough hp. To make the glow more realistic it also dims and 
                    brightens with randomized speed each time it hits an outer value.
