                        For my graduation project for highschool I made custom board game together with a working ai opponent. Together with a friend we came up with the concept after 
                        which i made the game in unity and all the visual assets for it. I also made a custom designed AI that would be playing against the player and that would be the 
                        main feature of the game. For designing the AI i didn't look too much at existing models and algorithms, instead opting to think of something myself and make that 
                        work. I did this because i think it is way more valuable to learn like this first and after, if i make an board game ai again, using the existing best algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea of the graduation project was that we would make a video game ai for a board game. We also thought it would be more fun if we also made that game 
                        ourselves. We came up with the concept during a train-ride to delft and refined it later during the development process. My friend would handle the research part 
                        of the project and i would make everything in unity. I started with making the base game first. I make the designs for the pieces and board, put them into unity 
                        and begun programming the moves. After getting the moves working i started making the ai that would play against the player. The first finished iteration of the 
                        ai always assumed the player would play the worst move because that would be better for the ai, so i added a quick check that the ai wouldn't give away pieces 
                        and take all the free ones to make it a bit better.

                    For the AI i made my own algorithm. This isn't how the best result is obtained, but I do learn more from it, and was the idea behind the Graduation project. The way 
                    the AI is designed it is basically an Algorithm, which applies to most game AI's. The AI loops over every piece it has and plays every possible move. It then plays 
                    every move the opponent can make in all those alternative board positions. This repeats until a certain search dept is reached. It then calculates the strength of 
                    final board positions. The AI scores the board on value of pieces of both AI and opponent, distance from own edge for ai and player and how many pieces are covered 
                    by other pieces. This board positions are then sorted by score and the best is played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has a pretty big flaw though. The AI will now always assume the player plays the worst move because the ai profits most from that. At this point there wasn't a 
                    lot of time left before the deadline, so i added some simple checks that my friend and i agreed one where always good and bad moves. The AI would now never give a 
                    piece up for free to the opponent. It would also always take a free piece.

                    I was in charge of making the game itself. The way i did this is by giving every piece a type. Then, if the player clicked on a piece it would look up where that 
                    type of piece could go. On those locations it was then checked if it was inside of the board and if something else was already there. If one of the moves landed on 
                    an opponent piece, it would place a red circle and if the player clicked that, it would remove the piece from the board. If the location was outside of the board or 
                    on one of the players own pieces, it wouldn't be placed and if it was a free spot a green circle would appear. There is also a check if the piece can move off the 
                    board at the end, and if so it places a green circle in the middle and the player wins if they move towards that spot.

                    For the game i designed the visual elements like pieces, the ui and the board. The idea behind the pieces was that they were very simple but distinct. I also 
                    designed the pieces to indicate where they can be moved to by following the points. This made sure that the player would always know what every piece was and 
                    where it could move towards. The board is a simple gird, but the colours are chosen to be easy on the eye to look at.
